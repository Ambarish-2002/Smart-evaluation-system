**********************  Project Abstract   *************************	 

The whole world is facing a huge crisis of COVID pandemic. Every field in world has been faced by a lot of difficulties.
We learned a lot of things from the pandemic. Education field was not exception for this. The mobile phones which were not allowed in classrooms, classroom has been shifted
to this mobile phones. Many things like online quizzes, online assignment, online exams, online viva etc., has been adopted. Teachers had been faced by a lot of difficulties 
while adapting to this changes. In evaluating theory papers, assignments it is really difficult task for them, like they have to download pdf of scanned response sheet from 
each and every student then evaluate them line by line. As they are new to evaluating paper, assignments on screen they require more time it might be 2 -3 times than that of
physically checking. So they are facing headache, stress due to increase in screen time. And more ever it leads to delay in result declaration. So to help teachers in online 
evaluation of papers / assignments we have made this project. 



******************  Innovativeness and Show Stoppers  *******************
       
We believe that this is completely innovative idea. 
It’s a solution for real problem faced by our teachers.
So if this will run successfully we can add a lot of features in this system.  

We can use this system to evaluate papers after pandemic also like it will scan the actual paper and evaluates paper directly, 
it will work similar of OMR system which we use for competitive exams. 

We can use this not only in college/universities but also in S.S.C. H.S.C. board examsss where the papers will be in count of lacs where 
it takes 2-3 months to declare result and involves a lot of human efforts and sometimes human errors also. So by using this system it will be super-fast and with less errors. 

Transparency will be there in results as the full process is automatic. 

We can utilize this saved time of teachers to heal today’s damaged educational system due to pandemic and build a new powerful educational system. 

For the sake of hackathon, we will be evaluating based on keywords, but if proper guidance is facilitated we can transform this project into a system with added 
functionalities such as, to detect correct diagram, grammatical correctness and more.
